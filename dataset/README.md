### What is this doing here?
In this directory is included just enough data to check out Genetic Programming running on some real data.

### What is this dataset?
This dataset pertains to the problem of Bioavailability of a drug (last column of a file) according to its molecular components (all the previous columns). In the work mentioned below, the variable to be predicted may be denoted as $%F$.

### Where does this come from?
In a true academic style:

- F. Archetti, S. Lanzeni, E. Messina, and L. Vanneschi, “Genetic programming for computational pharmacokinetics in drug discovery and development”, _Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines_, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 413–432, 2007.


### Can I use this dataset?
Well if you need it to test any machine learning algorithm on and just leave it on your local machine, go right ahead.

However, __if you are to publish this anywhere, please cite the source!__ Give credit where credit is due, much like I did.
